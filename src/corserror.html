      <h1>BIB has encountered an error</h1>
      <p>We're sorry, but it looks like BIB is unable to access this website due to CORS restrictions. It's like a digital fence keeping you out of the yard.</p>
      <p class="warning">Warning: Trying to bypass CORS may cause security issues and put your data at risk. Proceed with caution.</p>
      <p>If you're determined to access this website, you could try these tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Send a virtual fruit basket to the website owner to request they lift the CORS restrictions. Who knows, they might be in a good mood.</li>
        <li>Try using a different browser that isn't as picky about security. Just don't tell BIB, it might get jealous.</li>
        <li>Find a time machine and travel back to a time before CORS existed. We hear the 90s were a simpler time for the internet.</li>
        <li>Take up meditation and learn to accept that sometimes things just don't work out. It's a life lesson that applies to both technology and relationships.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thank you for using BIB, the browser that tries its best.</p>
